               sector backed with unprecedented levels of funding from venture
               capital funds or other large investment firms. These entrants
               seek to leverage industry 4.0 principles for the digitalization
               and industrialization of construction. In addition to new
               technologies, these firms also bring new business models that
               depart from the project-based tendering system found in
               traditional construction. The first new business model is
               vertical integration. These firms are structured as integrated
               hierarchical firms, keeping control of product architecture and
               processes in-house. These firms control production by developing
               their own off-site factories. The second new business model is
               digital systems integration. These firms leverage an integrated
               cloud-based product configurator to enable mass customization.
               Using principles of capital-light industry 4.0 supply chains,
               digital system integrators can manufacture parts from periphery
               supply chain partners suppliers, including new sectors such as
               automotive, aerospace, manufacturing or industrial. The third new
               business model is the transformation of an existing project-based
               business toward industrialized construction through the creation
               of a spinoff factories. The chapter includes examples of the
               three business models and concludes with a discussion of how new
               business models may be catalysts for potential disruption of the
               established construction sector.",

              element as well as a linear timber member, able to bear loads in-
              and out-of-plane. This article provides a state-of-the-art report
              on some selected topics related to CLT, in particular production
              and technology, characteristic material properties, design and
              connections. Making use of general information concerning the
              product’s development and global market, the state of knowledge is
              briefly outlined, including the newest findings and related
              references for background information. In view of ongoing global
              activities, a significant rise in production volume within the
              next decade is expected. Prerequisites for the establishment of a
              solid timber construction system using CLT are (1) standards
              comprising the product, testing and design, (2) harmonized
              load-bearing models for calculating CLT properties based on the
              properties of the base material board, enabling relatively fast
              use of local timber species and qualities, and (3) the development

              increasing degree of utilization regarding the load-bearing
              potential of CLT elements in the joints. The establishment of a

              lack of accommodation in Sweden, and during a ten- year period
              about one million new homes were built- the Million Homes
              programme. These buildings constitute about one fourth of the
              entire Swedish building stock and thus have a high societal value.
              Today they do not always meet current building standards and many
              are in need of refurbishment. The Million Homes programme
              incorporated a large variety of technical building solutions,
              andknowledge about former building practices is needed if
              refurbishment is to be successful. Industrialised builders in
              Sweden have recognized the use of a platform as one means of
              sharing knowledge. A platform is essentially the collection of
              assets that are shared by a set of products. In a platform for
              housing refurbishment the assets have knowledge and process
              content (as opposed to product content) and will probably also
              contain many relationships. The interview study carried out as
              part of the research shows that the main purpose of a platform
              concept is to standardize components and processes. To increase
              the possibility that a platform concept for refurbishment of
              buildings will beused for knowledge sharing the focus should be on
              the individuals who will actually be sharing their knowledge and
              especially on social motivations. It is important that managers
              and leaders demonstrate knowledge sharing behaviors as this will
              lead to the establishment of a culture where knowledge sharing is
              the norm; in the context of this study this is especially
              important for the creation of an efficient platform concept for

               challenged to improve its inherent problematic practices. Offsite
               production (OSP), under the umbrella of modern methods of
               construction (MMC), has been acknowledged as a means to help
               improve construction industry performance as well as meet new
               market demands through the provision of improved, adaptable, and
               sustainable buildings. However, the deployment of OSP systems, if
               not managed properly, may adversely affect the end result and be
               counterproductive. It is therefore imperative that the
               construction industry stakeholders learn and appreciate the
               specifics, merits, as well as the risks associated with OSP
               systems in order to achieve the desired outcomes and consequently
               improve industry performance.On-the-job-training (OJT) is usually
               sought to facilitate ‘experiential’ learning, which is argued to
               be particularly effective where a great deal of independence is
               granted to the task performer. However, OJT has been criticised
               for being expensive, limited, and sometimes devoid of the actual
               training context. In order to address the problems encountered
               with OJT, several virtual reality (VR) solutions have been
               proposed. This paper introduces one such VR solution prototype,
               in order to provide a risk-free environment for learning without
               the ‘do-or-die’ consequences often faced on real construction
               projects. The proffered solution provides a unique VR environment
               for practicing new working conditions associated with OSP
               practices. While the ‘scenes’ of the VR environment take place on
               a construction site, the environment predominantly targets
               professionals, such as project managers, construction managers,
               architects, designers, suppliers and manufacturers, to allow
               multidisciplinary learning to occur, and hence overcome
               ‘knowledge silos’ or ‘knowledge compartmentation’. The VR
               environment enables unforeseen problems often caused by
               professionals’ decisions, faulty work, and health and safety
               issues to occur; where the implications of which can be evaluated
               in respect of time, cost and resources. The VR environment
               proposed does not aim to resolve problems associated with OSP per
               se, rather aims to allow ‘things to go wrong’ and consequently
               allows users not only to ‘experience’ the resulting implications
               but also to reflect on those implications as part of the learning
               process. This paper discusses and presents the prototype for the
               first development phase of the VR interactive training
               environment. While the prototype was tested and validated with
               domain experts from industry, the research community, and
               academia from different EU countries, the data used in developing
               the prototype was constrained to one project in the UK which may
               limit the generalisability of results.",

              the manufacturing environment. Despite its potential benefits in
              terms of improvements in productivity and quality, this concept
              has not gained much attention in the construction industry. This
              development is founded in the fact that the far-reaching
              implications of the increasingly digitised and automated
              manufacturing environment are still widely unknown. Against this

              archaeologists excavated a structure of a wooden water well lining
              with a square base area of 80 × 80 cm and 140 cm in height. Due to
              the excellent conservation of the oak timbers, studies of
              technological details and precise tree-ring dating were possible.
              The used trees were felled in the years 5256/55 BC, which makes
              this well the oldest dendrochronologically dated archaeological
              wooden construction worldwide. It is the third well from the Early
              Neolithic period that has been discovered in the Czech Republic
              within the last four years. The design consists of grooved corner
              posts with inserted planks. This type of construction reveals
              advanced technical know-how and, till now, is the only known type
              from this region and time period. Thanks to the combination of
              annually resolved and absolutely dated tree-ring widths (TRWs),
              the Czech oak TRW chronology has been significantly extended back
              to 5481 BC. Wood anatomical identification of fragments from the
              well filling show mainly oak (Quercus spp.) and hazel (Corylus
              spp.), indicating a local forest composition dominated by these
              taxa. The shape of the individual structural elements and tool
              marks preserved on their surface confirm sophisticated carpentry
              skills. Based on these observations, we established a model for
              the “chaîne opératoire” from forest utilization to the final
              artefact at the beginning of the Early Neolithic period.",

              anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and consumes the vastest
              amount of natural resources. Widely considered a
              hard-to-decarbonise sector, improvements in buildings and
              construction are of fundamental importance for national and global
              targets to combat climate change. At material level, mitigation
              opportunities exist in terms of efficiency (using less of the same
              material) and substitution (using a different material). This
              article investigates the latter, with a global focus on the use of
              cross laminated timber to replace concrete floors in steel
              structural systems. This approach, whilst innovative, does not
              require any technological development nor upskilling of current
              professional practice, thus making it an immediately viable
              solution to accelerate decarbonisation. We combine Material Flow
              Analysis with Life Cycle Assessment across both spatial and
              temporal dimensions, accounting for different levels of uptake of
              the proposed hybrid construction in the next 30 years. Results
              show that greenhouse gas emissions saving potentials range between
              20 and 80 Mt CO2e (95\% confidence interval) with an average
              around 50 Mt CO2e in the case of full uptake of the hybrid
              construction system by 2050. Our analysis does not account for
              carbon sequestration potential in timber, which would make the
              savings much greater. Still, the overall savings represent a 1.5\%
              reduction of the annual greenhouse gas emissions generally
              attributed to construction, thus making it a non-trivial

                 land use and associated CO2 emissions until 2100 using an

                 buildings with wooden constructions, 106 Gt of additional CO2

               engineer-to-order firms: procurement and tendering, market
               knowledge, engineering, multi-skilled manufacturing, and

               longitudinal comparative case study examines how three
               entrepreneurial firms ? DPR construction, RAD Urban, and Project
               Frog ? in the San Francisco Bay Area describe their own strategic
               evolution and restructuring of firm boundaries over the past five
               years to enable greater adoption of digital manufacturing. Each
               firm has developed a different approach ? relational,
               project-based spinoff; vertical integration; or digital systems
               integration. Benefits and challenges are identified for each. The
               approaches are theorized as a form of strategic mirror-breaking

               doing the transforming, and how (and when) do we know it is
               happening? In Construction Management and Economics and
               elsewhere, there is a longstanding discussion amongst scholars on
               the topic of innovation in construction – but what of
               transformation in construction? Is it different, and if so – how?
               We set out with this Special Issue to answer these questions and
               advance the theoretical understanding of the transformation of
               the built environment, and how this requires the construction
               industry to transform accordingly. We believe that a
               “transforming construction” research agenda entails a
               multi-scalar perspective and therefore called for papers on
               industry-level transforming, firm-level transforming, and
               project- and programme-level transforming. We also recognise the
               process focus in contemporary social science through our framing
               of “transforming” construction as never-ending, and by seeking
               out accounts of how this is unfolding in practice. This resulting
               Special Issue will hopefully act as a provocation for new
               perspectives on transforming construction: it attempts to
               revisit, re-evaluate, and re-invent how we conceptualise both
               construction and construction research. The eight papers build on
               a strong legacy of research on innovation in construction
               management, while providing new insights on what is being
               transformed and how; locating, albeit tentatively, where the
               future debates are; and identifying spaces where rich data may be
               found. Readers will find a stimulating range of conceptual
               thinking and empirical evidence being brought to bear on change,
               innovation, and transformation, with extensive discussion of
               implications for future research on construction policy,
               projects, and people, broadening our field of view and drawing
               out strong new ideas to guide practice. The structure of this
               Editorial is as follows. First, we provide a synthetic recap of
               key themes within the transforming construction topic, as
               outlined in the Call for Papers. Secondly, we summarise the
               content of the eight accepted papers, positioning each paper
               under one of three headings, which reflect the multi-scale
               perspective of the Special Issue and as presented previously in
               the Call for Papers. We then go on to a discussion section, in
               which we set out what we see as five major themes emerging from
               the papers, characterising what transforming construction looks
               like from the perspective of these authors. There is a conclusion
               section to identify what the editorial team feels are the most
               pertinent reflections and questions, in a bid to offer some
               direction to future research in the area, followed by a short
               commentary on some limitations of the Special Issue.",

               Prior research highlights the importance of their modularization
               strategies, arguing that firms can either build the competence
               for modularization internally or can source them externally. To
               understand what shapes a firm?s choice to use external
               competences in its modularization strategy, we studied three
               leading construction firms. In this multiple case study, Alpha,
               Beta and Gamma are leaders in Asian markets, using reinforced
               concrete solutions in high-rise industrialized construction.
               Where external competences are available, our analyses show the
               work firms do to make them reliable and that their choice to use
               external competences is shaped by their reliability. Alpha
               modularized in a context with little available external
               competences, so it built new competences in-house; Beta chose to
               use the externally available manufacturing and assembly
               competences, using standards, remote monitoring and control of
               product architectures to make them reliable for their use in
               modularization; Gamma had available competences in the external
               context and initially sought to use them, but reliability
               concerns led to it modularizing by acquiring the firms to bring
               these competences in-house. Our contribution is to show how
               ensuring the reliability of external competences shapes
               modularization strategies. Further, we have identified actions
               that firms can adopt to make external competences reliable
               through: (1) use of international standards, (2) quality control
               procedures, (3) control of product architectures, and 4)
               acquisition of external competences. We provide implications for
               practitioners and policy makers seeking to transition to
               industrialized construction; and discuss new areas for research.",

               hostility and litigation between contractors are commonplace.
               Such a climate actively militates against collective learning and

               ?collaborative working?, contractors share risks, pool knowledge

              construction management education has attempted to use simulation
              software to introduce students to various construction concepts.
              However, these simulations have missed the mark when it comes to
              the fun factor which has affected the uptake and therefore the
              educational impact of such tools. CONVEX is an educational video
              game that was developed with the objective of teaching high-level
              construction management concepts without sacrificing enjoyment. A
              study was conducted that showed that CONVEX impacted players’
              ability to recognize construction activity sequence as well as the
              resources required to complete these activities. C...",

               market by 2030. However, UK construction productivity performance
               is regarded as weak, with low skills levels considered to be a
               key contributory factor. Consequently, off-site construction has
               been identified by the UK Government as a vehicle for improving
               productivity levels if the skills deficiencies in this particular
               market segment can be addressed. A series of projects were,
               therefore, launched by the UK Commission for Employment and
               Skills (UKCES) to encourage an R\&D approach to skills and
               development application in the workplace. This paper reports on
               one of these research projects, a University and Industry
               collaboration between two of the largest off-site timber platform
               frame manufacturers in the UK. The paper explains how a needs
               analysis process was utilised to develop skills training content
               tailored to the immediate needs of the industry partners. It also
               explores how working with academia and a wider community of
               stakeholders allowed this training content to result in
               sector-level impact via knowledge exchange activities and generic

               construction industry with reference to its philosophy and
               techniques. Human capital (HC) is widely discussed in different
               fields; hence, its meanings differ from one field to another.
               This study provides a detailed discussion on the development of
               the human capital theory under various themes and sub-themes. The
               study further seeks to discuss the several effects of human
               capital development on industry success and competitiveness and
               how this contributes to economic growth in developing countries.
               Relevant literatures on HC theory and development were extracted
               from Scopus. Scopus is widely acknowledged as one of the widest
               interdisciplinary databases for engineering, technology, science
               and medicine. The Scopus database features over 20, 000+
               peer-reviewed journals from over 5000 publishers. The Scopus
               database allows its users to perform more detailed searching
               opportunities compared to other databases such as Academic Search
               Complete, Art and Architecture Complete, Ebsco Host, SpringerLink
               and Web of science. The distillation of literature through
               thematic analysis revealed the various roles of human capital and
               its correlation with construction industry success and growth.
               Findings from this study revealed that the success of the
               construction industry is firmly related to the effectiveness of
               its human capital. The study revealed that the human capital
               theory is not without its criticisms and barriers. Practically,
               this study explores the various benefits of human capital to
               employers of the construction industry. The study suggests that
               human capital development plays a key part in retaining quality
               employees and recruiting prospects. Furthermore, investment in
               human capital goes a long way in improving employee satisfaction,
               organisational culture and increased productivity. This study
               contributes to the human capital discourse, which is the measure
               of economic value provided by employees with reference to their
               abilities, skills, values and knowledge.",

              to enhance the construction management educational experience. One
              of these new methods is showing real time videos that highlight
              the various elements of concern in the classroom lecture. The
              purpose of this paper is to use augmented reality technology (ART)
              and a layer of artificial visualizations to simulate the
              environmental context and spatio-temporal constraints of various
              construction processes. The superimposition of images serves as an
              instructional mechanism to virtually incorporate jobsite
              experiences into classrooms. This enhancement of spatio-temporal
              constraints enables learners to visualize context and hidden
              processes otherwise unattainable through traditional classroom
              lectures. Design/methodology/approach A significantly improved
              perception of reality is created through the combination of the
              learners’ ability to understand the complexity of construction
              products (e.g. assemblies) and associated jobsite processes by
              viewing the real environment augmented with computer-generated
              information layers. Findings Testing the ART video in a classroom
              with undergraduate construction management students showed that
              students who were exposed to the ART video were able to remember
              and identify the highlighted elements in the corresponding
              assembly more effectively than those who were not.
              Originality/value ART is a valuable tool in enhancing classroom

               construction industry in Queensland, Australia.
               Design/methodology/approach – An internet-based survey was
               administered to collect the opinions of construction employees
               about the workplace-training environment and their perceptions
               towards training. The survey intended to address the following
               research questions, specifically in relation to the construction
               industry. Findings – The survey results reveal that whilst
               overall participation in workplace training is high, the current
               workplace training environments do not foster balanced skill
               development. The study reveals that in the current absence of a
               formal and well-balanced training mechanism, construction workers
               generally resort to their own informal self-development
               initiatives to develop the needed role-specific theoretical
               knowledge. Research limitations/implications – The findings of
               the research are based on the data primarily collected in the
               construction industry in Queensland, Australia. The data are
               limited to a single Tier 2 construction company. Practical
               implications – The findings of this study can be utilised to
               suggest improvements in the current (or develop new) workplace
               training initiatives. Social implications – The research suggests
               that workplace training has positive relationship with career
               growth. The results suggest that in the construction industry,
               employees are generally well aware of the importance of workplace
               training in their career development and they largely appreciate
               training as being a critical factor for developing their capacity
               to perform their roles successfully, and to maintain their
               employability. Originality/value – This paper is unique as it
               investigates the current skills gap in both generic and skill
               areas within the construction industry in Queensland, Australia.

               probable futures, and evaluating, negotiating and giving form to
               preferred ones. Practices of making futures are increasingly
               online. Yet, as organizational participants come together online
               ? organizing remotely to make offline futures ? they lack the
               shared experiential knowledge that is gained through embodied and
               situated practices. In this essay, we argue that the lack of
               experiential knowledge makes future making online difficult to
               organize and vulnerable to excluding relevant expertise; dialogue
               may become inward-looking and self-referential within the online
               environment, with an emotional and cognitive distance from the
               futures being made outside of such representations. We draw on
               the pragmatist tradition to theorize online future making, to
               articulate its dynamics and the challenges that arise, and to
               suggest remedial actions. By conceptualizing future making as a
               form of inquiry ? as a distributed and reflective process that
               proceeds through engagement with representations of the future ?
               we identify three remedial actions for online future making: to
               solicit feedback, juxtapose alternatives and change medium. These
               remedial actions seek to compensate for the lack of shared
               experiential knowledge by both sustaining the online involvement
               of heterogeneous remote participants and by bringing in relevant

  abstract  = "Background Spatial skills are crucial for carpentry and are a
               major learning objective in the initial vocational training of
               carpenter apprentices. Carpenters specifically need to develop
               the capability to switch between two-dimensional (2D) and
               three-dimensional (3D) representations. Previous studies have
               explored spatial skills, but never in the context of vocational
               education and training (VET). This study sheds light on the level
               and evolution of spatial skills in the initial vocational
               training of carpenter apprentices in Switzerland. Methods In this
               study, 726 subjects (98 females) who were either carpenter
               apprentices, apprentices of another profession, or high school
               students, took a test on spatial skills with three parts: mental
               rotation, paper folding, and orthographic projections. The first
               two parts are widely used tests for spatial skills, while the
               last one was specifically designed to address the 2D-3D
               transition that is a core skill of carpenters. Results Carpenter
               apprentices do have higher spatial skills than would be expected
               given their general school level. In particular, their spatial
               skills were found to be similar to those of high school students
               and superior to those of apprentices of another profession.
               Carpenters’ spatial skills improve over the course of their
               apprenticeship. These findings confirm that spatial skills are
               trainable and suggest that the high spatial skills level of
               carpenter apprentices is due to a selection bias as well as to
               the training that they receive during their apprenticeship.
               Conclusions Carpenter apprentices improve their spatial skills
               over the time of their initial vocational training. As spatial
               skills are crucial in this profession, there is a need to develop
               further solutions that encourage further improvement of teaching
               and learning activities for spatial skills.",

               thick description of business innovation typologies relating to
               the offsite construction industry in the US. Offsite construction
               is ‘the process of planning, designing, fabricating,

               assembly to a greater degree of finish than in traditional
               piecemeal on-site construction’. Legislatively, however, the
               process was more clearly regulated and streamlined, occurring
               primarily offsite, which helps explain why one in every ten
               housing units constructed each year today in the US are
               manufactured homes. The US economy presents new opportunities for

               4.0 framework for the construction sector. Industry 4.0 promises
               to revolutionize how ‘things’ are made by using physical and
               digital technologies in an integrated manner. Similarly, the
               authors envision that the Construction 4.0 framework can
               fundamentally change the way that assets are designed,
               constructed, and operated. The idea of the Construction 4.0
               developed from the need of the construction sector to overcome
               the existing horizontal, vertical, and longitudinal fragmentation
               and to take a holistic approach to the improvements needed in the
               industry. In this study, a literature review of Industry 4.0 and
               its influence on the construction sector was undertaken. Based on
               this systematic literature review, the authors define the
               Construction 4.0 framework and provide its benefits and barriers
               to implementation. A key finding of the study is that building
               information modeling, and a common data environment form the key
               foundation for the implementation of the Construction 4.0
               framework. In defining the Construction 4.0 framework, the paper
               described its components and how its implementation is likely to
               proceed. The authors envision that by adopting Construction 4.0,
               the industry can transform itself into a highly efficient,
               quality-centered, and safe industry capable of successfully
               delivering the demands placed on it by society.",

  abstract = "Workforce training is needed throughout the construction industry
              to create and maintain competent workers; unfortunately, most
              construction training and education research focuses on university
              student education. The focus of this dissertation research is the
              current state of educational-theory embedded construction
              workforce training, how such trainings are effective, and how they
              may be further optimized based on established educational theory.
              This is accomplished through a review of construction training for
              current industry professionals, an evaluation of the assessment
              criteria used to measure effectiveness, followed by the creation
              of a framework for construction training. There is a lack of
              recommendations for improvement of construction training across
              the industry. To establish the current state of construction
              industry training, a review of education theory-integrated
              training for construction professionals is undertaken. To measure
              the extent of educational theory integration, this dissertation
              summarizes studies that meet inclusion criteria, identifies the
              frequency of occurrence of Bloom’s Taxonomy verbs as a measure of
              student learning outcomes, and identifies and compares commonly
              used words within the identified construction training literature
              and foundational educational theory literature. The results
              provide a baseline of education theory-integrated construction
              training research, from which gaps and best practices can be
              identified. Existing construction training programs are not
              properly measured for effectiveness. A review of the current
              methodologies used in construction trainings published in archival
              literature is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of training
              programs. These practices are compared against the Kirkpatrick
              Model, an evaluation framework. The assessment methodologies in
              the literature are synthesized with corresponding levels found in
              the Kirkpatrick Model. Properly integrating educational theory
              into construction workforce training has the potential to improve
              industry training; however, there is a dearth of studies that
              present details of this integration process. To address this gap,
              a training framework is created to educate material installers on
              material properties, selection, and installation. This framework
              is based on andragogical and Universal Design for Learning (UDL)
              principles. An assessment tool provides a method of evaluating
              similar training agendas to improve instructional design before
              training implementation. The created framework culminates by
              establishing linkages from educational theory to proposed training

               construction sector in the European Union Member States,
               foreseeing the Construction 4.0 era. The free movement of people
               is one of the rights of all citizens of the EU which also
               includes the free movement of workers. Labour shortages in the EU
               are expected to increase in the future due to a declining
               population and an ageing workforce. In order to recognize and
               forecast labour shortages, EU Member states use a variety of
               instruments but they do not answer as to whether it is possible
               to use migrant labour to appease those shortages. There are
               several systems used to classify labour shortages in the EU
               Member states. Most of the countries classify labour shortages in
               relation to different sectors or occupation groups as well as by
               skill levels, but in some Member States, classification is made
               according to the type of employment. Instruments used to measure
               labour shortages significantly differ from country to country.
               Several criteria are used for creating lists of shortage
               occupations and most of the criteria include demand side and
               supply side criteria. A majority of the Member States are facing
               labour and skill shortages in various sectors and the
               construction sector is not an exception. As total employment in
               the construction sector decreased, so did the share of employed
               migrants. Labour shortages in the construction sector can be
               eased by the availability of a labour supply willing to accept
               unqualified and low-paying jobs. The construction sector seeks
               low-, medium-, and high-skilled individuals and is most likely
               the sector where most of the incoming migrants will be working,

  abstract  = "Architects have been intrigued by prefabricated construction
               since the early twentieth century. Recent advances in design,
               engineering and manufacturing processes have led to a significant
               expansion in the use of pre-assembled components, which are
               fitted to finished structures on site. Collectively, such
               processes are becoming known as *offsite construction*. A
               ground-breaking text, Offsite Architecture establishes the
               current – and future – state of thinking in this field. A range
               of the most highly regarded thinkers and practitioners from
               around the globe share their ideas and practical findings on
               offsite prefabrication, examining theory and practice,
               opportunities and challenges, successes and failures. A timely
               response to the growing interest in this method, the book
               provides the fundamental basis for a critical, reflective
               approach to offsite architecture. Contributions from both
               academics and professionals make Offsite Architecture required

               combines the promise of industrialised building with the dream of

               magnetism over architectural culture which is as strong today as
               it was at any point in the past. The interest originated in the
               mid-nineteenth century, but achieved a strong uptake in the early
               to mid-twentieth century, and has continued in a cyclical pattern

               industry has found itself under increasing pressure to raise
               production output to alleviate a shortage in housing supply and
               reduce house price inflation. Within this setting, there has been
               much interest in the potential offered by off-site construction
               (OSC). The production strategies employed by private
               house-building firms however, are a direct response to their
               operational environment, and the adoption of OSC would arguably
               alter the way that they deliver their developments. Hence, there
               is a clear need to understand the relationship between production
               strategy and construction methods. Based on a case study of one

               potential impacts of OSC on current production strategies have
               been explored. The results indicate that the adoption of OSC
               approaches may alter the manner in which house-building firms are

               and restricting the very flexibility on which their own success
               relies. The findings have implications for the housebuilding
               industry, OSC manufacturers and construction research, given the

              subject to a shortage of skilled labor for the last two decades
              for many reasons, including the poor image of construction workers
              among the public, inadequate training measures, and an aging
              workforce. Reviewing the literature on the matter shows that the
              leading cause of shortage is low pay and increasing age of the
              workforce overall, while the demand for labor grows at a faster
              rate than the supply of labor grows. Poor worker retention
              practices were also identified as a cause for shortage and a
              reason for workers leaving the industry, and proper retention
              tactics are assessed, including monetary and non-monetary
              considerations for workers in order to foster a better

               housing and building industries, this book provides a timely
               overview of prefabricated and modular housing. The idea of
               prefabricated and modular housing is not a new one: since the
               19th century, designers, inventors, engineers, builders,
               developers, and entrepreneurs have all been fascinated by the
               idea of the factory-built home. But the current international
               housing shortages and affordability crises have given a new
               urgency to the need to transform building construction in the
               21st century. Richly illustrated and drawing on historical
               examples and contemporary design studies, the book takes the
               reader through the history, theory and design of the prefab,
               leading up to a discussion of contemporary problems and
               opportunities. Including a broad international survey, drawing on
               research from leading experts in the field, and previewing case
               studies of leading designers and companies, this book suggests a
               future scenario for industrialized building that will both
               challenge those professions concerned with the design and
               production of the built environment, and stimulate the public

               developing the required skills for Construction 4.0. It views the

               significant challenges limiting the uptake and implementation of
               Construction 4.0 technologies, especially in developing
               countries. In order to determine the skills required, this book
               examines the critical technologies of Construction 4.0, such as
               building information modelling (BIM), robotic construction, 3D
               printing and drones, which have transformed the construction
               industry, thereby creating digital, intelligent and sustainable
               construction solutions. Furthermore, the book considers the

               industrial building and planning from the end of the nineteenth
               century to the beginning of the twenty-first century. Drawing on
               research from the United States, Europe and Australia, this
               collection of essays highlights key moments in industrial
               architecture and planning representative of the wider paradigms
               in the field. Areas of analysis include industrial production,
               factories, hydroelectricity, aerospace, logistics, finance,
               scientific research and mining. The selected case studies serve
               to highlight architectural and planning innovations in industry
               and their contributions to wider cultural and societal currents.
               This richly illustrated collection will be of interest for a wide

                 with fabricators to enable unique designs that meet clients'

                 sustainability, making it an attractive option for owners and
                 project teams. The American Institute of Architects (AIA)
                 Modular and Off-Site Construction Guide serves as a primer for
                 architects to explore the value and opportunities of modular
